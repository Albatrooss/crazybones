## What is Crazy Bones

[Crazy Bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gogo%27s_Crazy_Bones) are small colorful characters that come in hundreds of colors and designs, each one with a unique name, design, personality and special ability. Gogo's were inspired by games from ancient Greece where children played by bouncing and throwing the carved knuckle bones of sheep, called astralgus - the game was called Astragals . The game has survived for over 3.000 years, and is known today as "jacks"; marbles are another variation. Each Gogo has a unique number for collecting and designed so you can hold and throw with one finger. Their 'Gogo's' name is a reference to 'Gogo Jacks' which is the English name for the ancient game of Tabas. And their name Bones is a reference to how the original game was played with real bones.
